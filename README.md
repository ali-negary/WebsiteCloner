#### Website Cloner: for now Website = CraigsList

- Basic process are done (initiating an app, models, urls, setting, and admin).
- Work on the front-end
- Inherit content of base.html to use in new_search.html
- Hard-coded the search page's front-end with pictures of Peykan.
- new_search method and new_search.html updated with soup.
- views.py updated with images abd it shows the first image of the add.
- tried to load the project on heroku but failed. will do that later.

(project is done for this phase. but files need to be cleaned up)

next phase will be using `digikala.com` instead of `craiglist`.
